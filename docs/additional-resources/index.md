## Baseball Analytics & Biomechanics

### Open Biomechanics Project
The [OpenBiomechanics Project](https://www.openbiomechanics.org/) by Driveline Baseball represents a groundbreaking initiative in baseball biomechanics research. This project:
- Provides open-source biomechanics datasets
- Offers tools for motion analysis
- Enables research in baseball player mechanics
- Supports computer vision applications in player analysis

{: .note }
The OpenBiomechanics Project's datasets and tools can be particularly valuable when combined with BaseballCV for comprehensive player analysis.
