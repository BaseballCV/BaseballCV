# Overview of BaseballCV

BaseballCV is an open-source computer vision toolkit that brings advanced object detection and tracking capabilities to baseball analytics. It bridges the gap between raw video footage and actionable baseball insights.

## Core Components

BaseballCV consists of three main components:

1. **Computer Vision Models**: Pre-trained models optimized for baseball-specific detection tasks:
   - Player detection and tracking
   - Ball trajectory analysis
   - Objetcs of interest detection (bats, gloves)

2. **Datasets**: Curated collections of annotated baseball footage:
   - MLB broadcast clips
   - Training datasets for custom model development

3. **Utilities**: Tools for working with baseball video footage:
   - Video processing pipeline
   - Annotation tools
   - Model training helpers

## Architecture

BaseballCV is built on modern computer vision frameworks:

- **YOLO**: For fast, accurate object detection
- **Florence 2**: For advanced vision-language tasks
- **PaliGemma 2**: For contextual understanding

## Design Philosophy

BaseballCV follows these core principles:

1. **Baseball-First**: All components are optimized for baseball applications
2. **User-Friendly**: Simple API design for ease of use
3. **Extensible**: Easy to customize and extend
4. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time analysis where possible
