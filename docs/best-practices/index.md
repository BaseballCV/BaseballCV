# Best Practices for BaseballCV

Understanding and following best practices ensures you get the most out of BaseballCV while maintaining efficient and reliable analysis pipelines. This guide covers essential guidelines and tips for working with the framework effectively.

## Data Management

### Video Quality and Processing

Video quality significantly impacts ball detection accuracy. When working with baseball footage, consider these important factors:

```python
from baseballcv.functions import DataTools

def prepare_analysis_footage(video_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Process video footage following best practices for optimal
    ball detection.
    """
    data_tools = DataTools()
    
    # Extract frames with optimal settings for ball tracking
    frames = data_tools.generate_photo_dataset(
        output_frames_folder="analysis_frames",
        max_plays=100,  # Balance between coverage and processing time
        max_num_frames=90,  # Capture full pitch sequence
        max_videos_per_game=10  # Ensure variety in conditions
    )
    
    return frames
```

For optimal results, ensure your source videos have:
- Resolution of 1280x720 pixels (HD)
- Frame rate of at least 30fps
- Clear visibility of the entire pitch path
- Consistent lighting conditions

### Dataset Organization

Maintaining well-organized datasets is crucial for reliable model training and evaluation. Here's an effective structure:

```python
from baseballcv.functions import LoadTools

def organize_training_data():
    """
    Set up a well-structured dataset following BaseballCV
    conventions.
    """
    load_tools = LoadTools()
    
    # Load pre-annotated dataset as reference
    dataset_path = load_tools.load_dataset(
        "baseball_rubber_home_glove",
        use_bdl_api=True
    )
    
    # Your dataset should mirror this structure:
    # dataset/
    # ├── train/
    # │   ├── images/
    # │   └── labels/
    # ├── valid/
    # │   ├── images/
    # │   └── labels/
    # └── test/
    #     ├── images/
    #     └── labels/
```

## Model Selection and Configuration

### Choosing the Right Model

BaseballCV offers several models optimized for ball tracking. Understanding their characteristics helps choose the right one for your needs:

```python
from baseballcv.functions import LoadTools
from baseballcv.model import Florence2, PaliGemma2
from ultralytics import YOLO

def select_appropriate_model(use_case: str):
    """
    Choose the appropriate model based on use case requirements.
    """
    load_tools = LoadTools()
    
    if use_case == "real_time":
        # YOLO for real-time tracking
        return YOLO(load_tools.load_model("ball_trackingv4"))
    
    elif use_case == "high_accuracy":
        # Florence2 for challenging conditions
        return Florence2()
    
    elif use_case == "detailed_analysis":
        # PaliGemma2 for in-depth analysis
        return PaliGemma2()
```

### Model Configuration Best Practices

When configuring models for inference, consider these optimal settings:

```python
def configure_ball_tracking(model, video_path: str):
    """
    Configure ball tracking with optimal settings.
    """
    # Balance between detection confidence and recall
    conf_threshold = 0.25  # Lower threshold to catch fast-moving balls
    
    # Process in appropriate batch sizes
    batch_size = 8  # Adjust based on available GPU memory
    
    results = model.predict(
        source=video_path,
        conf=conf_threshold,
        batch=batch_size,
        verbose=False  # Reduce output noise
    )
    
    return results
```

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

Efficient resource usage ensures smooth operation of analysis pipelines. Consider these practices:

```python
def optimize_resource_usage():
    """
    Configure BaseballCV for optimal resource usage.
    """
    import torch
    import multiprocessing as mp
    
    # Determine optimal number of workers
    num_workers = min(8, mp.cpu_count() - 1)
    
    # Initialize DataTools with appropriate workers
    data_tools = DataTools(max_workers=num_workers)
    
    # Clear GPU memory when needed
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Processing Pipeline Optimization

Structure your processing pipelines for efficiency:

```python
def create_efficient_pipeline(video_path: str):
    """
    Create an efficient processing pipeline following
    best practices.
    """
    # 1. Extract frames efficiently
    frames = data_tools.generate_photo_dataset(
        video_path,
        max_num_frames=90,
        delete_savant_videos=True  # Clean up temporary files
    )
    
    # 2. Process in batches
    batch_size = determine_optimal_batch_size()
    
    # 3. Implement proper error handling
    try:
        results = model.predict(
            source=frames,
            batch=batch_size
        )
    except Exception as e:
        handle_processing_error(e)
```

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Practices

Implement thorough validation to ensure reliable results:

```python
def validate_tracking_results(results, confidence_threshold: float = 0.8):
    """
    Validate ball tracking results following best practices.
    """
    # Check detection confidence
    confident_detections = [
        det for det in results 
        if det.conf > confidence_threshold
    ]
    
    # Verify trajectory consistency
    trajectory_valid = verify_trajectory_consistency(
        confident_detections
    )
    
    return len(confident_detections) > 0 and trajectory_valid
```

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in your pipelines:

```python
def handle_processing_errors(func):
    """
    Decorator for proper error handling in processing
    pipelines.
    """
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Handle missing files gracefully
            log_error("Required file not found")
        except torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError:
            # Handle GPU memory issues
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
            return process_in_smaller_batches(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            # Log unexpected errors
            log_error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
    return wrapper
```

## Integration Considerations

### Working with External Data

When integrating with external data sources:

```python
from baseballcv.functions import BaseballSavVideoScraper

def integrate_with_savant():
    """
    Integrate BaseballCV with Baseball Savant following
    best practices.
    """
    scraper = BaseballSavVideoScraper()
    
    # Fetch data with proper error handling
    try:
        data = scraper.run_statcast_pull_scraper(
            start_date="2024-05-01",
            end_date="2024-05-31",
            max_videos=100
        )
    except Exception as e:
        handle_savant_error(e)
```

## Documentation and Reproducibility

### Code Documentation

Maintain clear documentation for your BaseballCV implementations:

```python
def document_analysis_pipeline():
    """

    This function demonstrates proper documentation including:
    - Purpose of the pipeline
    - Input requirements
    - Processing steps
    - Output format
    - Error handling
